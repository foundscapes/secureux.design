# Working with a community

## Working with communities and setting up secure communications

How you conduct research, design, and build with and for communities is one
of the most foundational parts of human rights centered design. In an HRCD process, you should already be working with a community. This chapter is going to focus on safe and secure ways for you to collaborate with that community (and the next chapter focuses on the different kinds of research you and your collaborators can do together!). HRCD isn’t just about the structure for doing work, it’s how you are doing that work, and how that work can accidentally or inadvertently harm collaborators, users, and community members you work with.

## Centering the community

First and foremost, it is essential that you have the full support of the community you are working with to meet them where they are and get a well-rounded perspective of the problems you are trying to solve, which may not always be clear at first. Avoid missteps like helicoptering in without thoroughly learning about who you are working with, what they need help with, and how or whether your work will meet their needs. Too often, well-intentioned people with specific technical expertise have failed to effectively address a community’s problem, which may not need a technical solution, or who may be put at further risk by using that type of technology. It’s important to consider many factors before you even begin to work with the community. This is where your environmental scan from Chapter 1 will help you determine both what the community’s needs are, and what their capacity is to use your work to help address them.

### Step 1: Know your community

## Working with your community how to think about participatory design and localizing your project

The following outlines what you need to consider before you begin working on a project with your community. Localizing your work within the community’s context is a foundational first step. What this means is that you are taking language, cultural norms, and regional laws and norms into consideration when working closely with these communities. Ideally, those working with these groups are actually part of them, however, this is not always possible, given the needs which can be at odds with the resources of the communities.

If you are not from the community you are working with, it’s important to
work closely with community leaders who can translate their needs and work in tandem with you throughout the entire research, design, development,
and implementation processes. It is important that there is no room for misunderstandings or information loss between cultures and languages when you are designing products and services for these groups, so ensure that
any surveys or other communications you are creating for them are vetted, translated, adapted, and disseminated by
a trusted community member.

## Meeting your community where they are

It’s crucial to use tools that are familiar to the community you are working with. One great example of how this works in the field is unpacked by Neema Iyer,design and research expert, and founder of the NGO, Pollicy. Neema explains, “So, one time we were trying to do focus group discussions with refugees in Kenya. And we were like, can we use zoom and then we realized no zoom is totally out of the picture. Because first of all, zoom is very data heavy. Also, if you’ve never used zoom, you don’t know how to use it right, because you’ve just never had a reason to use it. So we actually ended up running the focus groups over WhatsApp, because everybody knows how to use WhatsApp. And you can set up a whatsapp group with eight people. And that actually worked out really well. Meeting people where they are on the platforms that they’re at and then having these conversations with people from the community, or people who work with them in the community, to get to serve as their spokespeople and to give you feedback on whatever you’re building.”

### Step II: Setting up a workflow with your community

One of our co-writers, Caroline, used to work with the Wikimedia Foundation, an open source1, educational nonprofit that powers Wikipedia. As a side note, it’s important to highlight that just because something is open source, that doesn’t make it necessarily human rights focused, or even equitable. Some open source projects can have really toxic communities that harm each other (Wikipedia included). That being said, there is a kind of accountability in an open source process. By sharing processes about how technology is made and allowing for community input, those developing open source code allows for a kind of public audit. For example, the Signal messaging app’s encryption system can be verified as secure because most of the code is made public, i.e. is “open source software” whereas Telegram’s cannot. Signal shares their protocol and open sources it- allowing others to test it, see how it was written and audit it; Telegram has not shared the code behind their encryption so it cannot be confirmed.

#### Exercise 1: Assess how secure your communications are

```
Before you start building the tool, platform, or technology, you want to know the people who will be using them. Consider collecting and analyzing information background to render a clear hierarchy visible from your stakeholders and research participants.
